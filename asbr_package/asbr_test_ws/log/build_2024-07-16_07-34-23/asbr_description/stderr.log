  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "realsense_description" with any of the following names:

    realsense_descriptionConfig.cmake
    realsense_description-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "realsense_description" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "realsense_description_DIR" to a directory containing one of the
  above files.  If "realsense_description" provides a separate development
  package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
